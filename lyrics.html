    Dr- got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
    Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
    Will I d- tonight? I don't know, is it over?
    Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure


    Lean with me, pop with me
    Get h-h with me if you rock with me
    - with me, - with me
    F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys


    Lean with me, pop with me
    Get h-h with me if you rock with me
    - with me, - with me
    F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys


   Told her if I di-, I'ma di- young
   Every day I've been gettin' -ed up
   Finally know the difference between love and dr-s
   Shawty tell me I should really sober up


   This s-t ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
   Fu-k one dose, I need two pills, two pills
   I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
   Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'


   I know I'm not right
   But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
   Girl, you hate it when I'm too h-gh
   But that's where I belong, where I belong


   Lean with me, pop with me
   Get h-h with me if you rock with me
   S- with me, - with me
   F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys


   Lean with me, pop with me
   Get h-h with me if you rock with me
    - with me, - with me
    F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys


    Eyes red, no Visine
    Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
    Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
    I laugh when they ask if my p-ss clean


    Huh, - with me, huh, pop with me, huh
    Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
    If I -, -, are you gon' drop with me?
    I don't even wanna think about it right now
    Let's get too h-h, reach a new h-h
    Take the - and the - at the same time
    Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
    Took too many dr-s, now I don't feel right


    Lean with me, pop with me
    Get h-h with me if you rock with me
    - with me, - with me
    F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys


    Lean with me, pop with me
    Get h-h with me if you rock with me
    - with me, - with me
    F-ed up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)
    Oh-oh
    Oh-oh-oh
    Oh-oh-oh
