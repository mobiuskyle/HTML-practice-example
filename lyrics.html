        <p>first verse</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            Drugs got me sweating but the rooms getting colder
            Looking at the Devil and the Angel on my shoulder
            Will i die tonight? ,I don't know ,is it over?
            Looking for my next high,Am looking for closure
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>chorus x 2</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            Lean wit me ,pop with me 
            get high with me if you rock with me 
            smoke with me ,drink with me 
            fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>Second verse</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            Told if i die, i'mma die young 
            Everyday i'm being fucked hard
            Finally know the difference between love and Drugs 
            Shawty told me i should really sober up
            This aint fiction its getting too real too real 
            Fuck one dose i am getting two pills two pills 
            Am looking for trouble so i know i am gonna find it 
            Ring ring plug hit my phone perfect timing

            I know am not right but am not wrong 
            No i am not wrong 
            Gurl you hate it when i am too high 
            But that's where i belong where i belong 
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>chorus x 2</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            Lean wit me ,pop with me 
            get high with me if you rock with me 
            smoke with me ,drink with me 
            fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>Final verse</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            Eye red,no visine
            crashed mustang,no saline
            yeah i love P's,yeah i love lean 
            I laugh when they ask if my piss clean

            Smoke with me ,Pop with me 
            Ayy Gucci store come shop with me 
            If i ever overdose, bae are you gonna drop with me 
            I don't even wanna think about that right now
            Let's get too high , reach a new high 
            Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time 
            Went to hollywood thrills from the steet life 
            Took too many drugs now i don't feel right
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>chorus x 2</p>

        <pre>
            Lean wit me ,pop with me 
            get high with me if you rock with me 
            smoke with me ,drink with me 
            fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
